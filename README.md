Video to Audio

The video summerizer is copied from Jaemin Cho's Video Summary: https://github.com/j-min/Adversarial_Video_Summary. 

The Vidio is created trying to generate a audio by the given video, and give users style choices of the generated video such as narrator, old movie, peaceful, emotional...

As an imaginer and absolute beginner of coding, I can't do the video to audio straightly for now, so it is planed to do like video->text->audio for its feasibility.

I'm quite happy if you are interested in what I'm trying to do, and I'm more than happy to make friends with you.
